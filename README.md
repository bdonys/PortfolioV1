# Brandon Sur Web Dev Portfolio Site v1

## Description

For the advanced CSS challenge, I've created a portfoilo website with a minimal design.
Used complimenting colors to increase focus on keywords and content elements - Black, Grey, and Tan.

The portfolio will be updated with JavaScript implementations.


All links and project images are placeholders.
